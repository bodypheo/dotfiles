##My dotfiles repo

This files is a first approach to dotfiling my system.
At the moment I have started this repo after migrating to Manjaro from Crunchbang.
I have mixed files from debian, as bashrc, with others ones I only use in Manjaro.
This is a WIP. **Do not use in un your system.** Take it only as reference.

I am also using the [pipemenus' cbpp repo](https://github.com/CBPP/cbpp-pipemenus). And [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).
