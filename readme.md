##My dotfiles repo

This files is a first approach to dotfiling my system.
At the moment I have started this repo after migrating to Manjaro from Crunchbang.
I have mixed files from debian, as bashrc, with others ones I only use in Manjaro.
This is a WIP. **Do not use in your system.** Take it only as reference.
I am using a Manjaro XFCE. But I have decided to implement my own version of openbox WM. (Yes, I know there is a Manjaro Openbox version, but I have installed the last release and there is not an openbox version yet, yes I know manjaro is a rolling distro, but I need to have a more "traditional" desktop and I opted for XFCE, and I wanted to try to configure an Openbox desktop from zero.)

I am also using the [pipemenus' cbpp repo](https://github.com/CBPP/cbpp-pipemenus). And [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot). And the first files were compiled by [init-dotfiles]([https://github.com/Aviator45003/init-dotfiles/]Init-dotfiles)
##To-do
Modificar conky, bashrc
